 * This class extends anglerange with the ability to deal with disjoint ranges.
 *
 * The internal storage isn't exposed, and there is no way to address an individual sub-range.
 * The reason for this is that the functions to add or remove ranges will resort the contents
 * of the internal storage arbitrarily.
 *
 * This class is part of the LatticeMatch program.
