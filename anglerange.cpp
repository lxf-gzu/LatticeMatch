 * A small class that deals with ranges of angles. Its members are two angles, maximum and minimum.
 * The main purpose of this class is to provide an easy way to determine the overlap of two ranges.
 * There is no support for disjoint ranges (yet).
 * Probably that would better be left for a separate class anyhow. Think: vector of anglerange objects
 *
 * There is an important convention with this class:
 * Ranges are always clockwise from the lower to the upper bound.
 * They include the lower and the upper bound, as this is required to be able to contain individual points.
 *
 * This class is part of the LatticeMatch program.
